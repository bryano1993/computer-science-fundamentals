1. What is a hash table?

A hash table is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs. 

2. What is hashing?

A process of converting arbitrary data into a fixed-length hash code using a hashing function.

3. How does a hash table store data?

By following a list of steps which include first, taking the key. Second, convert the key to a Hash Code using a Hashing Function. Third, Mod the Hash Code to get an array index.
Fourth, store the value in the array index.

4.How are hash tables and objects different?

They are different when it comes to their uses. Hash tables are used to identify the nature of your data.  You use a hash table when when your data contains a variable number of consistently formatted values, each with an identifier. 
You use an object if your data is a static number of distinct values of different types.


5. Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names.

- Hash Table

The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.

- Object

The name and location of every company in a given city.

- Hash Table

All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.

- Hash Table

The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.

- Object

6. Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

function hashTableForCustomers (name,address,phonenumber)
{
    CREATE HashMapSystem
    STORE each phonenumber (key) into HashMapSystem with associated name and address (value)
}

function lookUp (phonenumber)
{
    IF HashMapSystem has phonenumber
        RETURN information
        ELSE PRINT "I am sorry, that number does not exist"
    ENDIF
}

7.Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

function hashTableForInventory (productName,Id)
{
    CREATE HashMapSystem
    STORE each Id (key) into HashMapSystem with associated productName (value)
}

function lookup (Id)
{
    IF HashMapSystem has Id
        RETURN productName
        ELSE PRINT "I am sorry, that Id does not exist"
    ENDIF
}

8. Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

function hashTableforNewsPaper (publisher, publicationDate)
{
    CREATE HashMapSystem
    STORE each publicationDate (key) in HashMapSystem with associated publisher (value)
}

function lookUp(publicationDate) 
{
    IF HashMapSystem has publicationDate
        RETURN publicationDate and publisher
        ELSE PRINT "I am sorry, that publication date does not exist.
        
}
