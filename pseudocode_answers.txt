SHORT ANSWER

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to help them write algorithims

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

The computer will not understand it because it is made for humans to better understand what they are coding.
Therefore, it will not execute. 


PROGRMMING ASSIGNMENT

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION printGreaterNumber (numberOne,numberTwo)

If numberOne is greater than numberTwo 
    PRINT numberOne
ELSE
    PRINT numberTwo

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION printNumbers ()

FOR counter = 0 to 1 step 1
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION phonebookSearch (entry)

if anArray has specific entry in a phonebook 
    PRINT entry found
ELSE   
    PRINT entry not found
END FUNCTION


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function phoneBookSearch (entry){
const anArray = ['Bryan','John','Carl','Sarah','Joe']

if (anArray.indexOf(entry) > -1){
  console.log('Entry found')
} else {
  console.log('Entry not Found')
}


}
