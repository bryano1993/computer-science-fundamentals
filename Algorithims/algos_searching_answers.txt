Short Answer

1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

- Suppose there are 50 students in library (where obviously you canâ€™t shout) and you want a child named Ben (say), then the only way to find him is to go to each and every child and ask his name.
 The children are sitting in alphabetic order. That is how you will find  Ben and is considered a linear search.


2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

- Every programmer needs to know how to use binary search when debugging.
When you have a program, and you know that a bug is visible at a particular point during the execution of the program, you can use binary search to pin-point the place where it actually happens. 
This can be much faster than single-stepping through large parts of the code.

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

- Linear search because its more efficient in regards to unsorted items

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

- Binary search such as divide and conquer because it is more suitable for sorted items.

Programming Assignment

1.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

var search = function(assortment, chosenWord) {
  var begin = 0;
  var end = assortment.length-1;

  while (begin <= end) 
  {
    var center = (begin + end) / 2
    if (assortment[center] > chosenWord) {
      var end = center - 1;
    } else if (assortment[center] < chosenWord) {
      var begin = center + 1;
    } else {
        return center;
    }
  }

  return "word is not in the dictionary";
}


2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var netGoldFish = function(tank, markedFish) {
  for (let i=0; i<tank.length; i++) {
    if (tank[i] === markedFish) {
      return "Fish acquired!";
    }
  }
  return "Failed to find fish";
}
